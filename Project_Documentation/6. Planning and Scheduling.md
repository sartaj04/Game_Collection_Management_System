## 1. Planning <a name = 'planning'></a>
This section includes a set of tasks for prototype development and evaluation and the associated planning. The tasks are divided into 4 parts: [Front-End Planning](#Front-End Planning), [Back-End Planning](#Back-End Planning), [DB Planning](#DB Planning) and [Combination of Three Parts](#Combination of Three Parts), each part consisting of several subtasks. Under each subtask, the task's staff allocation, time estimation(time units=day√óperson) and dependencies are listed. The completion of these tasks will ultimately satisfy the [requirements](2. Requirements.md#requirements) and deliver the [software design](3. Software Design.md#software-design).

We adopt an 'Evolutionary Delivery' project structure. Firstly, we rank the work modules in order of priority. Secondly, for the detailed design and development phase of the plan, we iterate the cycle of requirements testing evaluation and improvement until all requirements are met or the project delivery date is reached. A [Gantt Chart](# Gantt Chart) is then created based on these detailed time plans and dependencies. Additional evaluation and improvement time is reserved to address the [risks](7. Risk Management.md) we identify.

### 1.1 Front-End Planning<a name = 'Front-End Planning'></a>

User Interface Design), which include Introduction Page, Categories Page, Login Page, Sign-up Page, Forgotten Password Page, Change Password Page, First Log in Page after signup, Store Page, Library Page, Single Game Page, Logout Page, New Friends and Club Page, Wishlist Page, Community Page, Guides Page.

## 2. Scheduling

### 2.1 Scheduling and Its Importance

Scheduling is the process of creating a plan or timetable for completing a set of tasks or activities. In software development, scheduling involves breaking down a project into smaller tasks and allocating resources such as time, money, and personnel to each task. This helps to ensure that the project is completed on time, within budget, and with the required level of quality.

### 2.2 Introduction of Gantt Chart <a name="Gantt"></a>
This section shows the Gantt charts based on the planning section. A Gantt chart is a type of bar chart used in project management. It provides a visual representation of a project's progress by breaking it down into individual tasks and displaying them along a timeline. Each task is represented by a horizontal bar across the length of time it needs to be completed, and the chart shows the start and end dates of each task, as well as any dependencies between tasks.

Gantt charts are used by project managers to plan, schedule and track the progress of a project. They can help ensure that tasks are completed on time, identify potential delays or bottlenecks, and communicate the status of the project to stakeholders. They are also useful for resource allocation as they allow project managers to see when resources are needed and plan accordingly.

### 2.3 Gantt Chart <a name="Gantt"></a>

<div style="text-align:center; border: 1px solid black;">
  <p align="center">
  <img src="images/Gantt_chart.png" alt="Gantt_chart" width="70%" height="70%">
<p align = "center"><em>Gantt chart for this project.</em></p>
</div>

Firstly, the Gantt chart contains the project name and the start date. In addition, the top right-hand corner of the image contains the date for each day within three weeks of the start date. First, the Gantt chart contains the project name and the start date. In addition, the top right-hand corner of the image contains the date for each day within three weeks of the start date. Being able to clearly see the date of each day makes the expected completion time of each task more visible. The length of the chart represents the number of days in which the task should be completed.

The chart also includes all the tasks to complete each section, as well as the task start time, duration and task due date. The chart contains the four main sections required, namely the database, the front end, the back end and the final combination of the three. Each part is represented in a different colour, which makes it easier to distinguish. The name of each task is also labelled.

The dependencies of each task can be seen according to the relationship diagram in the diagram. For example, in a database where the second task starts immediately after the first, this means that the second task is dependent on the completion of the first task. The diagram shows this dependency where it does not overlap from either end of the diagram. If there is an overlap, it proves that the two tasks can be carried out simultaneously without dependencies and vice versa. This makes the scheduled completion time of each task more obvious.
