# 5. User Interface Design
This file focuses primarily on the user interface design on the website that is proposed as a solution for the problem statement mention in [introduction](1. Introduction#introduction). 

We have developed the website after clear consideration of the functional requirements and software design that were prepared after careful research by the team. This contains the prototype of the flow chart and the functionality that we aim to achieve by the end of the project work. However, since it is an early design phase, the end result might not be exactly the same and will differ in minor areas. Nevertheless, all functional requirements will be kept in mind while developing the website and we will accomplish implementation of all these requirements. Below is the flow and detailed desscription of all the potential web pages that are a part of our web-based solution: 

## 5.1 Introduction Page
<div style="text-align:center; border: 1px solid black;">

Figure 2 i.e. the Categories Page Consists of some features like search bar and Login option for user to login similar to that of Introduction page.

</div>

### 5.5.1 Detailed User Interaction Introduction
The main function of Forgotten Password page is to let system to authenticate users before letting them change their password. When a user enters this scenario, the goal is to send a reset password link to the email provided by them. This is a typical implementation that is done across various websites and hence, has been chose to be executed in this project. 


## 5.6 Change Password Page

<p align = "center"><em>Figure 10: Webpage displays all details of a selected game.</em></p>
</div>

### 5.10.1 Detailed User Interaction Introduction
Figure 10 shows us the webpage that displays all the details of a single game when selected by the user. Firstly, the player can find out if they are logged in by clicking on "User name / login". The search bar can then be used to search for other games in the current game screen. From the leftmost menu bar the user can see the most recently viewed games and the current popular games. You can click on these games to browse them separately. At the same time, the icons, profiles and names of the games are displayed in the middle of the page. In addition, the number of ratings and reviews of the game is displayed in the "Status" area. At the bottom of the page are two buttons. Clicking on 'Add to library' will add the game to the library and then 'Add to wishlist' will add the game to the wishlist.

### 5.10.2 Reason Behind the Design
#### 5.10.2.1 Search Bar
The alternative considered for the design page was to add a back button to "Store" Page. However, if this were to happen, the user would not be able to go directly from the current page to the specified search screen, but would have to go all the way back to the "Store" page before searching for a game. Using the search box would provide a great deal of convenience and intuitiveness to the user.

#### 5.10.2.2 Add Buttons: Library and Wishlist
The purpose of using two buttons is to add both games to the library and to the wishlist. This allows the user to manage games and purchase games. The alternative would be to add a buy button directly to allow the user to buy the game, but then the ability to manage the game would not be possible. Provide users with more choices.

#### 5.10.2.3 Left Menu Bar
Allows users to see more games as well as making it easy for them to revisit recently viewed games. An alternative design solution would be to add a back button, but this reduces flexibility.

#### 5.10.2.4 Game Information Layout
The first thing a user looks at in a game is the name, icon, description, rating and genre. Placing this information in the centre of the screen helps the user to quickly review the game information and increases readability.

## 5.11 Logout Page
<div style="text-align:center; border: 1px solid black;">
  <p align="center">
  <img src="images/Logout_Page.png" alt="Logout_Page" width="70%" height="70%">
<p align = "center"><em>Figure 11: Webpage displays the details of logout page.</em></p>
</div>

### 5.11.1 Detailed User Interaction Introduction
Figure 11 shows us the webpage that displays all the details of the logout page. When the user clicks on the logout button they come to this page and then click on "here" to go back to the login screen to log in again.

### 5.11.2 Reasons Behind the Design
The purpose of this screen is to inform the user that they have logged out successfully and to allow them to log back in. The purpose of this screen is to inform the user that they have logged out successfully and to allow them to log back in. The alternative is to simply show that the user has logged out. However, this would increase the complexity of the user's operation and they would have to go back to the login screen one step at a time.

## 5.12 New Friends and Club Page

<div style="text-align:center; border: 1px solid black;">
  <p align="center">
  <img src="images/New_Friend_Page.png" alt="New Friends and Club Page" width="70%" height="70%">
<p align = "center"><em>Figure 12: Webpage displays all the details of new friends and clubs page.</em></p>
</div>

### 5.12.1 Detailed User Interaction Introduction
Figure 12 shows us the webpage that displays all the details of friends and clubs page. The user first needs to select the geographical area and then the system will return information about the matching players and clubs. The player information includes their interests and the club information includes interests and numbers. Use the scroll bar to view all the results returned. The user can then select either a user or a player and click on 'send request' to send an add request.

### 5.12.2 Reasons Behind the Design
#### 5.12.2.1 Dropdown
Using the Dropdown component saves space on the page and allows the user to select the location area. The alternative is to give a list or table containing most of the location information.

#### 5.12.2.2 Individuals and Club
The purpose of distinguishing between these two pieces is to allow users to find them better and to increase user readability and the hierarchy of the page. The alternative is to simply put the two types of information in one area, without separating them. 

#### 5.12.2.3 Select and Send Request
By allowing the user to select an individual or club and click on the send request button, the user can play with new friends and join a club. this allows the user to select multiple targets at once and then send the request, which is easier than the alternative of clicking on an individual user or club and going to a separate page to send the request.

## 5.13 Wishlist Page

<div style="text-align:center; border: 1px solid black;">
  <p align="center">
  <img src="images/Wishlist_Page.png" alt="Wishlist Page" width="70%" height="70%">
<p align = "center"><em>Figure 13: Webpage displays all the details of a user's wishlist.</em></p>
</div>

### 5.13.1 Detailed User Interaction Introduction
Figure 13 shows us the webpage that displays all the details of a user's wishlist. Users can click on the four buttons at the top to go to the specified page. Use the search bar to find a game. In this screen you can see the game icon, name, purchase status, price of new games and price of used games. The user can click on "Remove" to delete the game. You can then click on the "Seller" link to go to the seller's page. There are both used sellers and new sellers of new games.

### 5.13.2 Reasons Behind the Design
#### 5.13.2.1 Store, Wishlist, Library, Logout buttons
This makes it easier for users to switch between the three more important pages.

#### 5.13.2.2 Search Bar
Allows players to search for games inside the wishlist.

Figure 14 shows us the webpage that displays all the details of community of a game. The user can directly return to the "Library" page by clicking on the "Back Button". You can switch back and forth between the pages by clicking on "Community", "Guides" and "Reviews". Users can use the scroll bar to move up and down to see the posts in the community.

### 5.14.2 Reasons Behind the Design
#### 5.14.2.1 Back Button
Allowing the user to return to the store directly would be more convenient. The alternative would be to take the user all the way to the store page by clicking on the back button that comes with the page. But this would be too cumbersome.

#### 5.14.2.1 Store, Wishlist, Library, Logout buttons
Because these three areas of information play a large part in the user's understanding and judgement of the game, linked buttons are needed in all three pages. The alternative is to go back to the "Library" screen and then to the specified page.

#### 5.14.2.3 Structure of Community Posts
A post contains the content of the post, the headshot and the name of the poster. The reason for this design is that at a glance you can see various information about the post.
