# Prototype and Project Evaluation
## 1. Introduction <a name="prototype"></a>
This document will primarily focus on evaluating the prototype that was designed as a solution to the problem statement mentioned in the introduction during the requirements phase. The team has designed a web-based solution to help users manage their board game collections online. The website, 'Game Shack', can be accessed using this link.

Keeping the [requirements gathering](2. Requirements.md#requirements), [software design](3. Software Design.md#software-desiggn), and [planning](6. Planning and Scheduling.md#planning) in mind, we will review the designed prototype based on various factors in this document. Our goal is to critically analyse the developed prototype against the initial plan in order to discuss the achievements, challenges, improvements and future plans with regards to further development of the solution. 

There will be a brief discussion on the changes that were made in the design and associated reasoning. Validity of the time estimates that were made during planning and scheduling phase and also the task assignments amongst the team members need to be analysed. We will be discussing the problems the team has faced while developing the project and what they have done to over come those.


## 2. Prototype and Project Evaluation
This is the main section of this documentation. It will consist of detailed explanation of current prototype's features, it's scope in the real-world and how it has been achieved. We will also include discussion on possible improvements that can be made on top of existing code and evaluate the team performance that led to building the current prototype.

### 2.1 Current Prototype - Version 0
#### 2.1.1 Satisfied Requirements
The purpose of this section is to describe all the features that our prototype currently supports. This section will elaborate the functionalities that our web-based solution 'Game Shack' possessesand which were also included in the original functional requirements: 
1. A user can create an account securely with proper validation. Current prototype supports 4 kinds of identities : player, game developer, club manager and administrator. Each user has different roles but the current implementation was done for the user identity 'player' primarily which can be accessed by all types.  
2. We have implemented 3 different features on the UI for accessing the website: register to the website, login to the website and forgot password feature. During registration it asks for details such as a valid e-mail address, username, password, identity and favourite genres. 
3. Next, we have the home page that displays all the available offline board games in it. At the moment, it can display the hottest/most popular games as well as games based on various categories or genres. 
4. We have also implemented a search bar that allows a user to search for games that they like. Based on the given input, a new web page displays the relevant games to the user. The search bar also works when a user is not logged in, i.e., it functions the same irrespective of user login status. and view the game details.
5. User can click on any of the games to view all its details such as the rank, number of players needed, estimated duration of each game, game publishers. game designers, game artists. 
6. Users can also view the components of each game and the rules to play them in this single game page view. The FAQ and errate documents will be present in the component section. 
7. Lastly, the user can also view the reviews provided by other users as well as the users who are in the game community on the single game page. This function also works when the user has not registered to the website yet. 
8. The user can add the games that he likes to the library. The 'library' is a place where he can store games that he would like to purchase or keep for future references. It acts like a 'favourite' It is mandatory for a user to be logged in to the website to access this functionality. 
9. Similarly, the user can also add the games that he is ready to buy to his 'wishlist'. In the wishlist, additional details of the sale and regular prices, status of availability of the game for sale are displayed. It is mandatory for a user to be logged in to the website to access this functionality.
10. If the user decides to purchase a game, then he will be navigated to the seller page when he clicks on 'buy' button.
11. For every game, the user can provide his comments and ratings (on a scale of 1-5) by clicking on 'add review ' button. He can also view the comments and ratings provided by other users on the same game. 
12. User can join the community of each game. Community refers to a group of people who are interested in the same game and wish to communicate regularly. 
13. Recommendation system has been implemented based on all the games that a user has added to his library and wishlist. This can be accessed by clicking on the 'recommendations' field at the top of the page. 
14. Clubs section has been added in the website so that users can have a look at all the available clubs currently in the website. He can choose a club of his liking from a drop down box and join it instantly. 
15. User Profile is like a summary of all the details of a user. It includes information like email address, communities, library, wishlist and clubs. In each game page, the logged in user can view other users' comments and click on their user name to be redirected to their user profile page. 
16. The logout button is present on almost each page at the top right corner and it shouldn't be difficult for the user to leave the website securely. 

#### 2.2.2 Missed Requirements
This section covers the features in the solution that were missed out with regards to the requirements gathering done at the beginning. Though these requirements have not been implemented yet, it can be anticipated that they will be fulfilled in the upcoming versions of deployment: 
1. Currently the website supports full functionality to the user identity 'player'. There are 3 other identities namely game developer, club manager and administrator. These identities have access to the current features of the prototype but web pages to implement their individual roles are yet to be implemented. 
2. We initially planned for user account validation using captcha or one time password verification to improve security. This has not been implemented yet due to time constraints. 
3. User can request a link to their e-mail in case they have forgotten their password. Though the website displays as link sent successfully, in the back-end the Forgot Password REST API to send this link securely to the provided e-mail address is yet to be implemented. The link to reset password is generated correctly in the back-end mechanism as follows: 
   
   ![[Password_Reset_Sent.png]]

 4. The current search bar that is implemented cannot predict the games based on user input yet. One of the requirements was to implement auto-correction on user input which was missed in the current prototype. However, this can be implemented in the next version to improve user interface experience. 
5. Elimination of reviews and comments by untrusted sources has not been implemented yet. This can be done using AI models at later steps of prototype improvement as it is not a critical issue. 
6.  Filtering the reviews with tags like "most liked", "top most", "recently rated" was not implemented in the current version of the prototype.
7. Currently the game seller links belong only to geekgameshop.com. In the future, we would like to include multiple sellers from other e-commerce website. 
8. Recommender system needs to be implemented based on purchases, recently viewed tags, favourite genres provided by the users at the time of registration. It was also required to be implemented based on the location of the users. 
9. The user cannot yet search for friends or gaming communities based on their locations. This feature is yet to be implemented and can be discussed about in brief for future implementations. 

#### 2.2.3 Enhanced Features
Even though the above 2 sections discuss about the features that were missed or completed in terms of the functional requirements, there were multiple features that were implemented by the team. These features were out-of-scope but were put into effect resulting in a good prototype: 
1. The search feature that is implemented in the current prototype doesn't work with only game name or title, but it also functions fully with inputs like game designers, publishers and artists. 
2. Every game has it's own slogan, otherwise called as a 'short description'. There could be cases when the user remebers the what the game does but not the title. Our team provided a solution that can search for games if the type of user input is a phrase in short description as well. 
3. The search history is stored securely and the user does not have to worry about forgetting them. 
4. The Game logo which is present in the top left corner is clickable. This means, when a user clicks on the 'Game Shack' logo, they are automatically re-directed to the home page. 
5. The home page is abundant with all the games that are present in the database in a systematic manner. The UI design for this is advanced and it provides a smooth functioning to scroll across each genre effortlessly. 
6. Initially, there was no requirement to implement a user profile. The team has taken an extra step to implement user profile that contains all the summary of the user activity on the website. It consists of information like user's email-address, the games in their library, wishlist, the communities that they've joined as well as the clubs that they are a member of. 
7. While implementing the club interface, it was originally decided to navigate a user to the official club page. However, to preserve time and prevent too many websites being interlinked, the users can choose the club that they want from a dropdown box to join immediately. 
8. The users can look at reviews and comments that have been posted by others on the single game page. Similarly, they can also see who are present in the respective game community. These are displayed with a direct link to the other user profiles so that their activity on the website can be seen. 
9. Even though the typical recommender system usually works on user searches and purchases, we have implemented a more relatable recommender system based on games that were added to library or wishlist. This helps narrow down the genres that a user is interested in and suggest better options. 
10. A second recommender system also works on the genres of the games that are selected by the user. This can be observed when each game page that a user visits has a 'view recommendations' button at the bottom of the page. 
11. Our recommender system uses a jacardi algorithm which combines three parameters to give personalised recommendations to the user. The 3 parameters considered to find the scores of personalised games are genre(board games, card games, horror) score, mechanism (hand movement, drawings, rolling dice, shuffling) score and rating score. This is a very efficient algorithm that is implemented seamlessly in the current system.
12. There are certains pages that can be accessed without logging into the website. At the same time there are certain buttons that can be clicked in this scenario (User profiles, join communities, add games to library, etc) but to get access to full functionality, the users mjst be logged in to the website. This means that they need to re-directed to the login page at various scenarios. The team developed the backend such that all this can be achieved seamlessly in all cases. 

### 2.3 Design Changes - Justification
With respect to the software design and the UI design that were mentioned during the design phase, the prototype was not implemented to the T, as seen in the above section. Even though there were missed requirements, the team ensured that they have added enhanced features in order to maintain the quality of the prototype. 

However, in this section of the document we will look at the unexpected design changes and why they were made. The goal here is to prove that implementing these changes resulted in a positive outcome rather than a negative one. 

With respect to the functional design mentioned in the software design document as well the webpages layouts in the UI document, below are few changes made to achieve the current prototype: 
#### 2.3.1 Functional Design
1. **Login Interface:**  Though most of the features which were considered in the design phase have been implemented sucessfully in the prototype, there were few checks that were not made into the final draft of the prototype. This is due to time constraints and unavailability of backups at the time of implementation. Certain checks like 2-factor verification, password validation were not done due to above reasons, however, this didn't impact the user from creating an account on the website. To ensure that the security is increased in the future versions, we will implement the said features on top of the current prototype. 
2. **Library Interface:** This is one of the most drastically changes interfaces as part of this development. Initially we expected it to contain multiple layers like shelf-box-pocket layers which corresponded to frequency of use - games - components respectively. During the time of planning, the team didn't expect it to be a complicated process. However, at the time of planning, we decided to disregard this approach and changed it to a much more simple interface. The new approach included just adding or removing the games that the user is interested in to the library page. Seggregating them on the basis of shelf-box-pocket layer was too costly and hence omitted. This also helped in making the website look much more presentable and easy to navigate across. 
3. **Community Interface:** Initially the community interface prompted interaction between users, which is almost similar to a social media or chatting platform. It was a little challenging to implement this on the current schedule and right now it only allows us to view the users present in the game community. The club details are also taken via web scraping and displayed in a limited number. In the future, we plan to implement the said club and community interfaces by planning on a broader time line by considering risks proactively.  
#### 2.3.2 UI Design
1. **Change Password Page:** This is one of the pages that we are yet to implement but could not. This is because we weren't able to execute our code with the Forgot Password REST API in the given limited time. Though this was a missed requirement, it seems to be of negligible impact. It is one of the most important features but due to limites resources in the team and lesser time limit, it was decided to omit this function for now so that the other functions can be implemented successfully. However, this page will be introduced in the next version of the design of this prototype. 
2. **Library Page:** The Library page was initially made to look like it contained a lot of detailed information such as game details, community, reviews sections. It seemed to have a lot in similar to the single game page that could also contain these details. Hence, we have changed the library webpage to be simple and neat like the wishlist page. When games are added to this page, they are displayed in forms of cards with links beneath them to lead to game information page. 
3. **New Friends and Club Page:** Currently, we were unable to implement the new friends and club page as per the design mentioned in the UI planning. This was due to the complexity of implementing adding and removing friends. Similarly, the clubs were also implemented in a different manner. We allow the users to join clubs in which they are interested using the Clubs page. 
   
   However, the other users who are in the same community can be viewed because their user profiles are linkable. This means that the current design implemented a convenient way of accessing other user's club and wishlist details by clicking on their usernames. However, in future implementations of the prototype we aim to implement the add friends and chat features. 
4. **Wishlist page:** This page was initially structured to display all the games in a row-wise format like game icon, name, 'remove' and 'status' (availability of a game for sale), prices and seller information. This was challenging in terms of UI design and it didn't seem practical for the user to keep scrolling horizontally. Instead, we designed a better option where each game added in the wishlist looked like cards that contain all the said information in a smaller and more convenient space. 
5. **Community Page:** The 'Join Community' button in the single game page allows us to implement this function. In contrast to the proposed design, we wanted to add a linear representation of community posts and people in it rather than the said box structure. This made the web-page look less busy and it looked easier to the eye by allowing it to process the community information more cleamly. 
6. **Guides Page:** Initially the guides page was designed to have the rules, FAQ documents and errate documents at the bottom of the single game page. However, we decided to change the format so that the information can be displayed in a pop-up window after clicking on the 'view rules' button in the single game page. This helped us in saving space on the website and give it a cleaner look. 

### 2.4 Critical Appraisal Against Original Design Criteria
Based on the prototype evaluation that was noted in the previous sections of this document, it can be said that the prototype that was developed in order to solve a customer problem was actually a success. There were certain gaps in the development phase as seen in the missed requirements and also various problems observed in the [usability report](10. Usability Report and Analysis.md#). This helped us in determining how the existing prototype can be modified to acquire the user satisfaction. 

Coming to the first version of the deployed prototype as part of this project, its performance is pretty good and has captured almost 80% of the requirements. The missed 20% of the requirements were given justification in section 2.3 and they are going to be implemented in the next phase of developement, which we will see in the next section. The design criteria that was mentioned at the beginning of the requirements phase helped us in preparing a crisp layout of the prototype. The prototype that is deployed currently is a full functioning website that does all the basic functions needed for it to work as a solution. 

### 2.5 Hosting the Website in Real World
The end goal of the prototype is for it to be deployed into the real world so that it can be accessed by the general public. In order to achieve this milestone, there are many check points that need to be achieved and improved in regards to the current prototype (Let's say Version 0). 

**Version 1:** The first step is to ensure that all the missed requirements are implemented in this version of the prototype with top most priority. This can be started by making a second phase of project development and implementing the missed factors as early as possible. This should be relatively less time consuming as the base code from version 0 needs to be changed. 

**Version 2:** Also, we have done usability testing on the current prototype(Version 0) which has been recorded and analysed for potential severe problems. Based of the severity of the problems mentioned in the usability analysis, the team will implement changes to successfully generate a new version 2 of the current prototype while simultaneously addressing the user concerns. 

**Version 3:** After the above 2 phases are completed, there are few improvements that the technical and testing team have derived for future implementations of the prototype. They can be observed as below: 
1. The current dataset size in the prototype is around 2000-3000 games. This number was agreed upon by the team members to ensure that the prototype can function expectedly on this data. Now, the dataset needs to be increased up to 1-2 million games for Version 2. After gathering the dataset, the old dataset needs to be updated to this one. 
2. The algorithm used in the current recommender system is called Jaccard Similarity. It is a common proximity measurement used to compute the similarity between two or more objects. Currently, the recommender system is working on scores calculated based on the genre, mechanism and ratings. This could potentially slow down the system when it grows to millions dataset. In such cases, the larger dataset can be processed much faster using IR (Information Retrieval) system for better recommendations.
3. Execute the recommendation system based on the description of the games to ensure more personalised game collection management as well as user satisfaction. 
4. Implement auro-correct functions on the input given in the search bar. Sometimes the user might provide incorrect data or games that are not present in the DB. The current system (Version 0) says that 'No results are found' in this case. But in Version 2, we aim to suggest games that the user could be looking for. Along with the auto correct function, we also aim to include a prediction based search so that it can suggest the options while the user is typing in the search bar. 
5. The Version 0 doesn't allow users to chat with the people in the same game community or allow them to add as a friend. We aim to complete this requirement by introducing a secure, encrypted chatting facility amongst the communities and also 1-to-1 friend add function. 
6. As seen in the missed requirements, the forgot password REST API is yet to be implemented. This should be executed with utmost priority in this Version 3 such that the user receives a mail and subsequent steps can be followed to reset their passwords with ease. 
7. At the moment, the purchase option re-directs to only 1 seller called geekgameshop.com. In this version, we aim to include other sellers like Amazom, AliBaba Express, eBay, etc so that users are provided with a wide range of options to purchase products. 
8. Since the dataset size in the prototype is pretty low, and with the aim of increasing our dataset size to 1 million entries, this will eventually result in a larger database. The current implementation uses SQLite DB software. However, in Version 2, we will change the database to prequel database management tool

After the necessary planning and development is completed for Version 2, we will conduct a second round of usability testing with larger number of participants. This can be done to compare the results exponentially to the first test and get multiple point-of-views to improve the product quality and user satisfaction. 

### 2.6 Planning and Team Function
During the planning and scheduling phase, the scrum master and developer 1 were in charge of assigning the tasks and laying out the plan. However, the team leader and developer 2 were in charge of the risk management. The planning was done in a systematic manner by categorising it into 3 parts: front-end, back-end and database planning. These tasks were assigned by considering the skillset among the team members accordingly. With the help of the gantt chart, the team has taken a meeting to understand the flow and timeline for completing these tasks. 

However, in the risk management document, there were few risks that were predicted and have occured during the development phase. For few team mates, it was difficult to exeute their tasks as their tasks were too complex. This resulted in all the members of the team participating in the development phase. This is an example of the risk where a certain team member might lack the skill-set and assigned work incorrectly. 

Though the team members were all assigned their tasks, it was difficult to implement strict time management as everyone had multiple deadlines to keep up with in a very short period of time. This added to delay in implementing the tasks and prototype within the planned time. Though a leap time of 7 days was taken, the team was able to complete their work to the best of their abilities and develop a full functioning prototype within the planned fixed date.

## 3. Conclusion
The development of the prototype was a success is many ways than expected. The team was able to work hard and meet most of the requirements that were gathered at the beginning of this project. There were reasonable justifications that were provided as to why certain requirements were omitted. They can be considered as valid since the prototype 'Game Shack' is currently hosted successfully on cloud server. It is running as expected and has managed to cover core functionalities of the requirements. The usability testing that was done before deployment also states that there was good user satisfaction with the current prototype 

However, there are few areas where the project could have been improved. For example, the team could have done a better job in planning the task assignment and managing the risks. There could be improved communication from next time and systematic planning that is being adhered to. The project work was a learning curve to all the team members in all aspects of software development and it has given those without any work experience, a taste of software engineering from start to finish. 

Overall, the project was a success. However, there are some areas where the project could have been improved as mentioned above. The team will take these areas into consideration when planning future projects. All the feedback from the usability report and future hosting of the project in real-time are to be handled next. We will ensure that the plan mentioned above will be followed with better scheduling and risk management.
