### 1. Risk Tracking Record <a name="log"></a>

This is a page to track information about all the risks that have been observed during the course of this project. Each time a risk is observed, it needs to be updated by the responsible team member. If any new risks are observed in this process, they will be logged in this document as well. As it is an on-going process, this should be updated each day by the end of the deadline so that it can be refered to in future projects. 
| Risk Name | Start Date | End Date | Responsible Team Member | Ticket Number/Link | How was it handled |
|---|----|----|----|----|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Taking long amount of time to connect front-end, database and back-end components | 14/04/2023 | 17/04/2023 | Jichao Yang, Guanwen Lu and Sartaj Syed | 4 | <div style="width: 300pt"> 1. Break down the whole work into smaller tasks. Divide the work of connecting the front-end, database, and back-end components into smaller tasks that can be completed in a shorter amount of time. For example, the back-end will not start combining the front-end and back-end when all the features (i.e. tasks) have been implemented, but will release a version after one or two features have been completed, and then the front-end will start combining for those few implemented features. Once the combination is complete, manual tests are carried out to determine if the functionality of the back-end and the presentation of the front-end meet expectations. This helps us to identify any potential issues earlier and take corrective action before they become bigger problems. 2. Develop a detailed plan: Create a plan that outlines the steps required to connect the front-end, database, and back-end components. Make sure that all the necessary tasks are included, resources, and timelines in the plan. 3. Use appropriate tools and frameworks: Use appropriate tools and frameworks to simplify the process of connecting the front-end, database, and back-end components. For example,  we use a web application framework like Django.  4. Test at each stage: Test each component when connect back-end with front-end to ensure that they are working correctly. This will help to identify any issues early on and take corrective action before they become bigger problems.|
| Quality of the prototype might change | 14/04/2023 | 17/04/2023 | All the team members | 16 | 1. Define quality standards: Clearly define the quality standards for the prototype, including any specific requirements or criteria that must be met. Make sure that these standards are communicated to everyone involved in the development process. <br/> 2. Prototype review and feedback: Establish a process for reviewing and providing feedback on the prototype at various stages of development. This will help to identify any quality issues early on and allow you to make any necessary adjustments. <br/> 3. Use version control: Use version control software to track changes to the prototype and ensure that you have a record of all modifications made during the development process. |
| UI design could lose few web pages due to optimization | 01/04/2023 | 17/04/2023 | All the team members | 17 | 1. Identify critical web pages: Identify key web pages that are critical to user experience and app functionality. This may include frequently visited pages and those pages that provide functionality that satisfies the functional requirements of the software prototype. <br/> 2. Prototype review and feedback: Establish a process for reviewing prototypes and providing feedback at various stages of development. This will help catch any quality issues early on and allow you to make any necessary adjustments. For example, when completing certain functions and combining front-end and back-end tasks every day, hold a daily meeting to demonstrate and discuss the degree of realization of the functions, make appropriate suggestions and make improvements according to the feasibility of the suggestions. |
| The developer system may crash due to various factors or server failures are seen | 01/04/2023 | 17/04/2023 | Jichao Yang, Guanwen Lu and Sartaj Syed | 2 | 1. Use cloud-based solutions: Consider using cloud-based solutions that offer robust infrastructure and provide automatic failover mechanisms. This can help to reduce the risk of system crashes or server failures. <br/> 2. Use version control: Use version control software(git) to track changes to the prototype and ensure that the records of all modifications made during the development process are recorded. We created different functional branches to implement front-end and back-end functions and pages in parallel. Working on a feature branch provides benefits such as isolating changes, collaboration, code review and better control over releases. |
| Observed issues during testing and debugging phase take long time to get fixed | 01/04/2023 | 17/04/2023 | Jichao Yang, Guanwen Lu and Sartaj Syed | 7 | 1.

Research the provider's track record and read reviews from other users to ensure that they have a good track record for uptime and availability. <br/> 3. Monitor the deployment process: Monitor the deployment process closely to identify any issues that arise. This includes monitoring the performance of the system, as well as any logs or metrics that may indicate issues with the deployment. |
| Halting of dependant tasks due to issues observed in different tasks | 17/04/2023 | 18/04/2023 | All the team members | 6 | 1. Identify dependencies: Identify all the tasks that have dependencies and their criticality. List them in a way that helps to understand which tasks need to be completed before others can start. <br/> 2. Have a contingency plan: Create a contingency plan for when issues arise in one or more tasks. The contingency plan includes steps to mitigate the impact of the issues and get the dependent tasks back on track. <br/> 3.  Prioritize critical tasks: Prioritize critical tasks and focus on resolving issues that halt dependent tasks. This helps to ensure that the most critical tasks are completed on time and that the impact of any delays is minimized. |
