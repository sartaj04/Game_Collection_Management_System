### 4. Software Design <a name = 'software-design'></a>
The primary goal of the software design is to capture all the [requirements](2. Requirements.md) of the project and then develop a plan that will be followed in the later phases of the project. The software design sets the baseline on how the project will be formed and it needs to demonstrate the design goals successfully. Based on the requirements developed so far, the team was able to establish a software design plan in both functional and system perspectives which are discussed further in the document below.

#### 4.1 Software <a name="software"></a>

1. Front-end: The front end requires us to develop a website with pages that allow user interaction. We have developed the expected user interface of this solution and can be checked in [this page](5. User Interface Design.md). There are many technologies that can be used to develop the front end and after careful consideration, the team has decided to primarily use JavaScript for this development. Since the website requires heavy interactive and dynamic features such as animations(game logos, game items that keep moving), image sliders(for checking recommended games across the page), JavaScript provides the relevant APIs in handling these requirements. Another reason to use JavaScript is, it provides powerful tools to acquire interactive design between the front-end and back-end like:
- Event-handling: This is used for handling movements like keystrokes, clicks, mouse movements. It helps create the required features mentioned in the user interface document like drop-downs, buttons, text boxes. 
- Animation: JavaScript provides necessary features required for animation like sliding, fading, rotation of game logos. 
- DOM Manipulation: It allows the developers to implement collection management excessively as it enables the users to add/remove items or games without the requirement of reloading the page. 

2. Back-end:
Just like the front-end development, back-end development is equaly crucial. We will mostly be using node.js which is a popular back end technology used in web development. We will be using it to connect our server that receives and sends the data for communication between the front & back end interfaces to the application. The application controls and processes the communication such as responses and requests when user is utilising the front-end web features such as button clicks, selecting from the drop down menu. 
Node.js is known to be one of the most useful tools in web development as it enhances certains non-functional requirements of the system. Since the number of games and users are expected to be extremely large, we will be user databases and node.js to work on the scalability of the project. It also helps in real-time maintenance of the data as it is extremely useful in this project to keep track of the games stocks, users' library/collection. The back-end management also requires a connection with the information in databases as it needs to update the accordingly to the user actions.  

3. Database:
We require different types of databases that need to store information about all the users and their activities to keep the pages in the front-end updated. We will be using MySQL, which is an RDBMS (relational database management system) to handle such operations. 

We will need a user database, that contains the information of the users when they create an account. This is useful at user authentication as the implemented security protocols will access this database to verify the provided user credentials during login. It will try to match the provided data accordingly in the database and proceed for user access validation. 

The second database that we will use is games database. This will consist of all the information of the games available on the website. It will contain data like game_name, game_ID, price, sellers, minutes_taken_to_play, no_of_players, rank, stock, etc. The front-end & back-end code will access this database to display information in the store and library pages of the webpage. They will also be updated accordingly in the game collection management. 

The third database will be a join of the above mentioned databases such that it can be used to maintain the user activity and game details simultaneously. With all the activity that the user does in removing, adding or updating the games in his collection, both the databases need to be updated in real time. This can be done with the help of back-end development that will send the calls which are later processed by the SQL queries. 


#### 4.2 Functional Design <a name="functional-design"></a>
The functional design comprises of the solution to the question: "What does the design do?". We have discussed the software solution that we will be implementing in order to satisfy all the [requirements](2. Requirements.md). This is the basic design about the behaviour of the website that we will be developing as part of this project work. We will keep in mind that this is not the final functional expectation and it will be evolving with aim of improvement through-out the design, testing and delivery phases. Below are the main interfaces that we will be developing in order to satisfy the requirements:

#### 4.2.1 Login Interface <a name="login-interface"></a>

In this interface, the main goal is to develop a login or user registration screen that is simple and easy to follow. The developer must keep in mind about how the interface is going to be implemented in order to ensure security and safety of each user account created on the webpage. In order to develop this interface, we will be taking the below considerations into account: 
    + The first step is to create a a database that consists of all the user information that is relevant during this step. The user database will contain data such as user name, password, e-mails, contact information. 
    + After the user database has been designed, we now have to focus on the User Interface design for login or sign-up. We will design the first webpage of this website so that the user can enter his credentials to access various features of this website. However, in case of User Registration for the first time, the interface will provide a form with various input fields for gathering user information. After entering the necessary details, the user can enter the submit button to proceed further. 
   + In the second step, we will be implementing few checks to ensure that all the information entered by the user is relevant in the registration part. We will implement password policy check and throw a warning when the password does not satisfy the requirements. Similarly, warnings will be thrown in case of empty input or data with incorrect input types. 
   + Once, all the data has been validated and stored in the database, the backend for user authentication will be implemented. In this scenario, the code has to verify the user's credentials against the database and grant or deny access to the website accordingly.
   + Once the user has been authenticated, we will be implementing server side sessions in order to keep track of the user's state while they go through various features of the website. The responsibility of these sessions is to ensure that it stay alive when needed and get destroyed when the user logs out/other disruptions occur. 
   + In order to maintain the security measures, we will be making use of SSL encryption technique to protect the user data from malicious softwares or hacking. We can also try and implement the hashing encryption techniques, captcha verification, or one-time-password verification by sending code to user e-mail or number. 
   + There are many types of softwares for implementing the above interface. As mentioned in section 4.1, we will be using JavaScript for the backend implementation. One of the tools provided by Node.js is Passport.js. Passport.js is a widely used framework to develop the required authentication strategy for this website. 

#### 4.2.2 Library Interface <a name="library-interface"></a>
After successful implementatoion of the login interface, we will be moving to the Library Interface. Since the primary goal of the website is to offer user with all possible options of the offline games for purchasing, the library interface is introduced to handle and organise complicated data. The primary requirement of this interface is to allow the user to manage their game collection cleanly. The content that is contained in this interface represent the assets owned by the user. When the players acquire new games or items from the store interface, they are added to the library interface.

Unlike some design cases, we chose to place the Library screen before the Store screen because, the product that is being developed is primarily a game management tool. The importance of accessing collections will be given top priority. Also, this is more in line with real-life situation where players are first confronted with their assets and then make decisions to go to shops or clubs depending on their shopping or social needs. 

For simple and crisp implementation of this interface, we will be following the shelf-box-pocket system. This is explained in detail as below:

##### 4.2.2.1 Shelf layer <a name="shelf-layer"></a>

The Shelf is the initial screen of the Library interface, and its visual appearance should resemble a realistic bookshelf, with each game arranged on the shelf in the form of a box. 

Users can retrieve and move freely through the items in the shelf. Users can fix the games they use most often to the top of shelf for easier access. Users cannot place too many games on the shelf or use some sort of secondary catalogue (as they cannot do so in real life either). This would result in  increased complexity of the interface and reduced user usability. Games that are too many or used too infrequently will be stacked at the bottom of the shelf. 

##### 4.2.2.2 Box layer <a name="box-layer"></a>

Each **game** that is present in the shelf corresponds to a **box**. Each box contains accessible components that are associated with the game. These components can be divided into 3 categories:

Item: Items are the materials that are provided with each offline game. They include things like cards, board pieces, extensions of games. They can be termed as the physical components of the games. These are one of the main things that the user can manage(add/remove/update) in their library collection. The items are organised in form of pockets that we will be discussing in the next section.
Textual contents: Textual content is the descriptions or records that players often need to look at, such as manuals, lists of items, etc. Items and textual content make up everything the player should see when opening the game in real life.
Links: Links include reviews, shop screens, rules forums, etc., which can provide players with the additional information they need to help them.

Box is the type of object that indicates a specific game. In real life, players will open boxes to learn about items when buying games, to organise them when during game collection, and to interact with players. Therefore, players should be allowed access to Box under all three interfaces of Store, Library and Community on the website. Through the 3 mentioned Box components, players should be able to access all relevant details for a given game so that it gives clarity and improved usability. 

##### 4.2.2.3 Pocket Layer <a name="pocket-layer"></a>

Pockets are the third and innermost level of storage units under Shelf and Box layers. They contain all the items that are physically present in any game such are board pieces, dices, cards, houses in monopoly, hourglass or pencils in pictionary, etc. As part of this design we will allow the player to customise(create and modify) the pockets according to the additional items that they might want while purchasing the games. After a user has confirmed their requirements in each pocket, they can add them in either box(game) layer or shelves. 

Although pockets are highly customisable according to the user's will, the system still offers some classic and common default options when players create pockets, such as deck of cards, default pieces in board games, etc. These are very common forms of item organisation, which will provide convenience to the user and ensure some consistency in the system. 

Also, for new games added to the collection, the items in the game(box) are organised in a fixed format. This is an initial version of pocket that contains the default items required to carry the play of the game. 

For management purposes, the user can open several pockets at the same time and display two pockets at the same time. The user can move or copy items between them (e.g. at the beginning, the user copies items from the initial pocket to a custom pocket). In each pocket, the player can customise, retrieve or delete items.

#### 4.2.3 Store Interface <a name="store-interface"></a>

The Store interface allows users to search and browse for all games present in the market and add them to their collections (Library interface). It is like a catalog of all the games that are available for sale or that are even upcoming in the future. It is a platform for interaction between game manufacturers and gamers. Game designers can publish their designed games in the store and advertise them to players. Players can learn about and evaluate games in the marketplace based on various information. 

One of the main tasks of the store is to guide users in the selection of games. The system contains statistical information from a market perspective and makes personalised recommendations for the user. Such a task is already widely available on existing online shopping platforms, so we mainly refer to designs that are already widely used, such as the rankings and personalised recommendations on steam or boardgamegeek. 

This section corresponds to functional requirements such as recommendations, search, reviews, and transactions. For specific games, the Store interface fulfilss more external-oriented needs than the Library interface. Some information is repeated between the two interfaces, so they are accessed via some links to each other (e.g. Game links (Box)). Even though this leads to redundancy, this design will make it easier for users to locate the information and functions they need, enhancing usability. 

#### 4.2.4 Community Interface <a name="community-interface"></a>

The community interface mainly meets the offline social requirements of users.
Players can search for groups or individuals by game and region to play the games with. They can also browse through the full range of game shops in a given location. 

Users can access the addresses or contact details of these objects through this product, but the prototype of this product is technically difficult to include full social media functionality for the time being. Nevertheless, the product can try to connect the right groups or individuals to each other in the future. This can be achieved by adding tags to players such as their favourite game categories, their best scores, etc. 

In this interface, we will be introducing a new type of user called the club organiser. They have the capability to update the game clubs on the websites along with details like address, contact information, players etc. They can also manage their clubs by organising or disbanding the clubs, promoting friendly competitions and notifying the players present in these clubs. 


In order to get more insight about the mentioned goals and functional behaviour of the website, the team has designed a detailed User Interface design that can be checked [here](5.%20User%20Interface%20Design.md). 

#### 4.2.5 Control Flow Diagram <a name="control-flow"></a>

<div style="text-align:center; border: 1px solid black;">
  <p align="center">
  <img src="images/control_flow_diagram.png" alt="control_flow_diagram" width="70%" height="70%">
<p align = "center"><em>Figure 1: Control Flow Diagram.</em></p>
</div>

The diagram outlines the control flow of our website. The first screen is the introduction page, where users are given the opportunity to register in or browse categories. The login screen will be displayed if they decide to login. They can then choose to create a new account or log in using their current details. The password reset screen will be displayed if they choose the forgotten password choice instead.


After successfully registering, users are taken to the interests screen where they can select the game genres, enabling personalized recommendations. They will then be taken to the store website, where they can access both custom recommendations and the most popular game titles right now. They can then select to go to the categories page or the library website from there.


The library page is the hub of our website, where users can access their complete game collection, see which titles they've played, engage with the community, and submit reviews. Depending on their actions they’ll be navigated to different pages, such as the community page, guides page, wishlist page, review page, and new friends page. These sites each have special features like the ability to write on community forum boards, read game manuals, add ratings, and add new friends. The website also has a logout icon that directs visitors to the logout page.


#### 4.3 System design <a name="system-design"></a>
The website design contains the following interfaces: Login interface, Library interface, Store interface and Club interface. We will be discussing them in detail as follows:

<div style="text-align:center; border: 1px solid black;">
  <p align="center">
  <img src="images/system_design.png" alt="system_design_diagram" width="70%" height="70%">
<p align = "center"><em>Figure 1: System Design Diagram.</em></p>
</div>



The provided diagram illustrates the high-level system design for our web application that facilitates offline game collection. It displays the components and how they are connected, as well as how data is transferred between them.

The front-end of the application consists of three primary components: the catalogue, wishlist, and library. The catalogue displays available games to the user, allowing the user to add their desired games to their wishlist, and eventually to their library. The library helps users navigate to the desired webpage for game purchases.

Web content and game data are the two primary databases present in the  application's back end. The necessary data is gathered and transmitted to the front-end via user-designed services that make use of HTTP APIs.

The club manager is in charge of organising games and setting up member competitions based on their preferences. This feature enhances the user experience by providing them with a platform to compete and engage with like-minded individuals. 
Lastly, The recommender algorithm also keeps tabs on user behaviour and interests. Similarity index algorithms are used to create the user's customised game suggestions based on the data gathered.

In conclusion, this high-level system design presents the elements that go into an online application that facilitates game purchases.. Additionally, it emphasises how various elements work together to provide a smooth user experience.





#### 4.4 Implementation Path <a name="implementation"></a>
1. Requirements Gathering: The functional and non-functional requirements were thoroughly planned our as mentioned previously. The team was able to determine them by doing research across various online platforms. This helped us in developing the software baseline of the project as seen in the above sections. We have to plan the further planning and risk analysis in order to calculate the estimated time of satisfying these requirements in the design process. 
2. Coding: As the solution approach is based on web development, we need to concentrate on 3 perspectives: front-end, back-end and database maintenance. We have discussed these in detail in the [above section](#software). The team is able to draft out the webpage with the help of user interface design as well. With the help of all these documents, it should be easier for the team to start the coding process as everyone is having clear vision of the outcome. 
3. Testing: As part of agile methodology, we have to maintain everything in a systematic order. This means that the devlelopment and testing processes go hand-in-hand at regular intervals. The team has skills in introducing integration and unit test cases during the development phase. Instead of waiting for the coding phase to complete first, we will start testing the code together. This will help us in building a robust code and implement error handling.
4. De-bugging: With the help of the testing process, it will help us in identifying the issues at a faster rate. All team members will be involved in this process in order to find and fix as many issues as possible before the integration phase. The aim of this stage is to ensure that the end product is robust and contains as few bugs as possible. 
5. Integration: Once the debugging phase is successful and the prototype has been developed with most issues fixed, it is in a state of product testing. The code will be deployed and tested on various machines and browsers to check the performance of the webpage. It should be able to function correctly without any major glitches and must satisfy atleast the ["must-have"](2. Requirements.md#must-have) functional requirements that were determined in the requirements page. At this point, the prototype should be expected to work uptil an extent as major bugs will have been solved with the help of testing and de-bugging phases. This phase determines the quality of the prototype developed. 
6. Deployment: The final part of the software development is the deployment. By this stage, the developed product must be satisfactory in terms of performance as well as requirements captured. If the product has been developed within the given timeframe and there are no issues after multiple rounds of testing, it is ready to be deployed to the users.
