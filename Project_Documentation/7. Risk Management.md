### Risk Management

This page consists of the various risk management strategies in relevance to the requirements and planning done so far for this project. Our goal is to develop a working prototype which was mentioned in [project proposal](1. Introduction.md#project-proposal). In order to ensure that we can identify potential issues and their consequences before they occur, we have implemented various risk identification, prioritisation and quantitative/qualitative prediction methods that will be discussed in detail.

### 1. Risk Assessment

In order to identify the potential risks that could hinder the performance of the development mentioned in [project proposal](1. Introduction.md#project-proposal), risk assessment was done with careful consideration of factors such as project scope, timeline, resources. The risk assessment process involved analyzing the potential impact of each risk on the project objectives and evaluating the likelihood of its occurrence. Based on the results of the risk assessment, appropriate risk management strategies were developed in risk control section to mitigate or avoid the identified risks and ensure the successful completion of the project on time.

#### 1.1 Risk Identification

Considering the [Gantt chart](6.%20Planning%20and%20Scheduling.md#Gantt) that contains the flow of activities and tasks that need to be finished by the provided deadline, there are various categories of risks that can potentially arise and compromise the flow of work. In this section, each risk is discussed and categorised accordingly. It is known that the project timeline is of 3 weeks for developing and testing a working prototype which is mentioned in the scope of this project. We will be creating a risk list based on the planning and design that have been made so far:

* Quality of product: The end result is to develop a working prototype of a website that can make the game collection management a convenient experience to the user. Failure to uphold the quality of the prototype by the end of the deadline will prove to be a major risk. It is important to develop a product with appropriate requirements and planning in order to prevent the quality from declining.
* Optimistic Scheduling: The team was given 1 month to write down the requirements of the prototype and an additional 2 weeks to handle the scheduling of tasks. These tasks are divided upon the 3 different [software design](3.%20Software%20Design.md#software-design) components namely backend, frontend and database. All 3 are co-dependant and scheduling was done in such a way that they can be achieved in a step by step process. However, with the time of 3 weeks, the team has to be conscious about how to put in their time and develop the prototype successfully. Otherwise it is a risk of poor scheduling hindering the development process.
* Compatibility Issues: The team consists of 4 members and everyone has been assigned respective tasks to handle the UI development, setting up a database and backened development to connect them all. Since all 4 members will work on separate systems, there could be a potential risk of compatibility issues in case each team member needs access to other codes or softwares.
* Design Deviation: The software and UI design were captured by the team in the previous assessment and now, the risk of not accomplishing all the requirements is high. While developing the design the team took into consideration of the timeline and their skills as well. If the team is unable to follow the design, it could prove to be a risky factor. Of course, the team can make additional changes and implement new designs to improve the existing one. However, they must predict any risks that might change the design drastically.
* Security breaches or hacking during development: This is one of the primary risks to consider in software development. It is important to use the right kind of security protocols and anti virus softwares to protect the team members' systems from being attacked by unwanted sources. There have been multiple cases where databases have been hacked in some of our previous projects. This provides to be one of the major risks as it could lead to loss of sensitive data. (take backups)
* Unavailability of a team member due to health issues: This is one of the possible scenarios that could lead to delay in the development or testing process. It is very unpredictable and can lead to unprepared backups. Determining the severity of their illness, expected duration of their absence and adjusting the plan accordingly are crucial steps to help improve this risk.
* Database management and collection: One of the main steps of this project in case of handling a data base is to get data that can be used and managed across the front and back ends. We need to collect information like all the available offline games, their features, their components, trusted links to sellers. It isthe responsibility of the teeam member working on this to ensure that suck risks are kept at minimal and inform the team in case of delays.
* Unavailability of required software tools for development: We will be using the softwares that have been mentioned in the software design document. Sometimes there are chances that the required libraries or APIs are unavailable for team to develop the webpage according to their requirements or require payment for plans. These things need to be checked before starting the development process in order to minimse the impact on the end product.
* Problems in connecting backend, front-end and database: Due to experience from working in projects beforehand, there were many delays and issues when there was failure to develop a connection between the backend code and database to the front end, or inour case, the UI part. It is a very tedious and crucial part of the software development and will require careful coding by the team while keeping the timeline in mind. We need to develop the right kind of RestAPIs to handle the navigation between the webpages and also
* User data protection breach: This prototype requires the users to register with the website by providing information like their mail IDs or phone numbers. It is a very high risk and poor performance by the team if they cannot ensure the protection of this data. There has to be a license agreement provided by the development team stating the measures they have taken to ensure user data protection.
* Team Skills and Time Management: There were meetings held inorder to determin which team member is suitable for the tasks mentioned in the gantt chart. There could be scenarios where the software design might demand additional software skills that could be unfamiliar to the skills possessed by the team members. This is also connected to the unavailability due to health issues risk because the backup team member may not have the skills similar to the affected team member. Hence maintaining a well balanced team for this project is important
* More issues while testing: Testing is one of the most important part in software development. When the team members are testing their code and implemented features, it could lead to finding more complex errors that might be too time-consuming to debug and solve. Moreover, while testing, if we face more errors than expected, it could lead to delay in reaching the milestones accordingly. Though testing is a very important phase of the implementation path, it should be done with equal importance to development in order to avoid delays.
* UI design deviation: If we go through the [User Interface](5. User Interface Design.md#user-interface) design document, there are certain web pages like the catalogue, wishlist, library etc. These pages require heavy features to be added in them and could result in potential loss of time in case of improper development or testing.

#### 1.2 Risk Prioritisation

Now that we have identified the different types of risks that could occur in our project, the next step is to prioritize them based on their potential impact and likelihood of occurrence. This will help us determine the relative importance or priority of each risk and focus our resources on mitigating the most significant ones. We will be using below 2 methods to help us with identifying risk priorities:

##### 1.2.1 Quantitative Risk Assessment

This is the process of prediction the probability of a risk that is bound to happen during the time line of this project. In order to calculate the probability, we need to first determine 2 factors :

* Size of Loss: This is quantified in terms of number of days. It refers to the period of time that is lost due to the identified risk. It is the number of days that the project work is delayed or unable to go as planned.
* Risk Exposure: It refers to the amount of time that a project is exposed to a certain risk when it occurs. We can calculate the risk exposure by considering the amount of time or number of days that the project is exposed to this risk until it has been resolved or mitigated.

By determining the Size of Loss and Risk Exposure of each risk we can calculate the Probability of the risk using below formula :

Probability(risk) = (Risk Exposure / Size of Loss) \* 100

##### 1.2.2 Qualitative Risk Assessment

Sometimes certain risks cannot be quantified due to uncertainties in estimations and difficulty in finding the appropriate common "units" that can be used to measure the relative impact of the risks. In this approach we will be categorising risks based on their probabilities and impact.

We can consider probabilities as certain, probable, possible or unlikely. Likely, the impacts can be of types negligible, moderate, severe, catastrophic. With various combinations of these probabilities and impacts, we can categorise the risk priorities as critical, high, medium, low or trivial.

### 2. Risk Control

The risk control section will tell us how to handle the risks that were identified and prioritised in the risk assessment section. The main goal of this section is to :

* Eliminate risks that have high priority and chance of occurring when possible
* In case of risks that cannot be eliminated, then inform how they can be mitigated in the strategy section
* Monitoring and maintaining a log of these risks through out the course of the project

#### 2.1 Risk Resolution

In this section we will be discussing how the risks present in the [risk list](#risklist) are to be mitigated or eliminated. The Risk resolution table shows how a strategy is developed to resolve the risks mentioned above. This table will also contain the Method column. The method column will determine how the risk is to be handled during the product development phase. Few methods of handling these risks include :

* Avoid the risk: This method involves completely avoiding the activity or situation that poses this risk.
* Transfer the risk: This method applies when the piority of a given risk can be changed in case it becomes less critical
* Buy information about the risk: In case any risk requires additional efforts by the team in researching about the task, this method is used.
* Eliminate the risk: Remove risky functionality from current project version and treat it as a research project.
* Assume the risk: Understand the risk can happen and be prepared to take the hit if it does( low impact only)
* Publicise the risk: Inform customers/upper management that the risk exists to minimise surprise if it occurs.
* Control the risk: Alter schedule and resource allocation to accommodate the risk and lessen its effect
* Remember the risk : Document all risks which affect the project for reference in further projects. This should be logged for all the risks that are observed.

| Risk | Method | Strategy |
|------|--------|----------|
| Security issues can be observed such as DB getting hacked. | Avoid the risk | It is important to get a secure client that can be accessed only to team members. It should always be refreshed and changed periodically to prevent loss of data.  |
| The developer system may crash due to various factors or server failures are seen | Avoid the risk | Ensure that the dataset that is being used is of lower memory as this is the most common root cause of server failures. |
| Issues occuring while trying to deploy the system into cloud for execution | Buy information about the risk | Try to start deploying system into the cloud at earlier stages to be prepared for un-predictable errors.  |
| Taking long amount of time to connect front-end, database and back-end components | Control the risk | This is an expected case in any software development project. It is important that the team is prepared to handle these issues and predict the average time it will take to resolve them.  |
| User data is breached or accessed by dangerous external sources. | Publicise the risk. Remember the risk | The first priority of any software is to include security licenses, encryption and multiple layers in security so ensure data protection. In worst case scenario, let the public know and immediately work towards adding more security to the web page.  |
| Halting of dependant tasks due to issues observed in different tasks | Control the risk  | The team should keep everyone informed about expected delays. This will help responsible team members to handle delays better.  |
| Observed issues during testing and debugging phase take long time to get fixed | Control the risk | The purpose of testing and debugging is to fix all issues observed. But, the team must plan for worst-case scenarios and schedule tasks with leap time as well.  |
| Deadlines or milestones are not achieved on planned time | Transfer the risk | This can be expected in software development teams, but in case all the milestones are achieved on time, this can be transfered to low impact risk otherwise it should be a critical issue. |
| Team member can be unavailable due to health problems and has no backup | Avoid the risk | This is an uncontrollable risk and must be handled by providing knowledge transfer sessions once a week to the team so that members will be prepared.  |
| Compatibility issues faced while trying to download necessary softwares | Eliminate the risk | This risk can be completely eliminated if the version control is done correctly for downloading or installing softwares. The team should treat this as a first step before starting any coding/development.  |
| The planning or scheduling is too packed giving little time to fix issues | Control the risk | Consider various aspects such as team skills, expected leap times, issue handling time and risk prediction while planning or scheduling tasks and deadlines |
| Unavailability of certain APIs or libraries for coding | Assume the risk. Transfer the risk.  | Try to search for alternative methods to implement the code in case of unavailability of required APIs. This risk can be transfered in case an alternative has been found or the absence of such libraries do not have a huge impact in development process.  |
| Inability to get all required data to maintain in the database. The entire system depends on this data | Buy information about the risk | Ask the responsible member to gather atleast a small amount of data for initial phases. The size of the database can be increased gradually. |
| Debugging errors is very complex and time-consuming | Buy information about the risk | For such type of errors, it is recommended that the team members maintain a log for debugging and fixing these kind of issues beforehand.  |
| Problems observed during testing are more than expected, hence causing delays | Control the risk | Add extra days or time to planning schedule to handle such type of scenarios |
| Quality of the prototype might change | Transfer the risk | The team aims to develop and optimize the web-based solution that contains all the requirements. This can allow the risk to lower its priority.  |
| UI design could lose few web pages due to optimization | Transfer the risk | Currently the UI design consists of 16 pages and the team can make a better interface by optimising the flow between the pages ensuring user satisfaction  |
| Development can require skills that are not excelled by the team currently | Buy information about the risk. Assume the risk. | In case of this risk occurring, it is best encouraged for the team members to do as much research as needed to gather these skills. They can watch education videos or learn courses online.  |
| Miscommunication within the team members or irregular updates provided by the team. | Control the risk | Call multiple meetings if team does not provide updates regularly in their tickets. |
| Lack of team motivation in participation of the tasks assigned to them | Assume and control the risk | It is known that not all members can get the tasks that they like. If another team member can so it, it can be re-assigned in extreme cases. |
| Team member can be unavailable due to health problems and has provided a skilled backup | Assume the risk | The backup can quickly pick up where the affected team member stands. |


#### 2.2 Risk Management Timing
This is a crucial stage in the risk control phase. The purpose of risk monitoring is to maintain any changes or keep track of all the risks that were observed in the web-based solution development process. Risk monitoring is an ongoing process, and it typically involves regular reviews and updates to the risk management plan. 

During risk monitoring, it is necessary to track the identified risks, assess the likelihood and potential impact of each risk, and monitor the progress of risk mitigation strategies that have been discussed and mentioned in this document. This helps to ensure that the risk mitigation efforts are on track and are effectively addressing the identified risks. In-order to maintain a record of the risks that are observed in this process, we have design a new page called "[Risk tracking log](8.%20Risk%20Tracking%20Record.md#log)". This document will be updated simultaneously by the team leader as well as the team members through out the software phase. Currently it is empty and only consists of the format. It will be updated on a regular basis with links to the tickets where each risk is being observed and solved.
